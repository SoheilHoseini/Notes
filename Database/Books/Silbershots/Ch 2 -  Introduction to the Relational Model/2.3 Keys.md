1. A *super-key* is a set of one or more attributes that, taken collectively, allow us to identify uniquely a tuple in the relation. A super-key may contain extraneous attributes.
2. We are often interested in super-keys for which no proper subset is a super-key. Such minimal super-keys are called *candidate keys*. It is possible that several distinct sets of attributes could serve as a candidate key.
3. We shall use the term *primary key* to denote a candidate key that is chosen by the database designer as the principal means of identifying tuples within a relation. Usually primary key attributes are also underlined. The primary key should be chosen such that its attribute values are never, or are very rarely, changed.
4. A *foreign-key* constraint from attribute(s) A of relation r1 to the primary-key B of relation r2 states that on any database instance, the value of A for each tuple in r1 must also be the value of B for some tuple in r2. Attribute set A is called a foreign key from r1, referencing r2. The relation r1 is also called the referencing relation of the foreign-key constraint, and r2 is called the referenced relation. 
	Note that in a foreign-key constraint, the referenced attribute(s) must be the primary key of the referenced relation. The more general case, a *referential-integrity constraint*, relaxes the requirement that the referenced attributes form the primary key of the referenced relation.
