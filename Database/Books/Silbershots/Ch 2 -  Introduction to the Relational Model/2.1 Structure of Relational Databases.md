For each attribute of a relation, there is a set of permitted values, called the domain of that attribute. We require that, for all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r be atomic. A domain is atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units.

Even then, if we split the value from the phone number attribute into a country code, an area code, and a local number, we would be treating it as a non-atomic value.
