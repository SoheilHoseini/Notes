Often, several operations on the database form a single logical unit of work. An example is a funds transfer. The funds transfer must happen in its entirety or not at all. This all-or-none requirement is called **atomicity**. In addition, it is essential that the execution of the funds transfer preserves the consistency of the database. That is, the value of the sum of the balances of A and B must be preserved. This correctness requirement is called **consistency**. Finally, after the successful execution of a funds transfer, the new values of the balances of accounts A and B must persist, despite the possibility of system failure. This persistence requirement is called **durability**.

A transaction is a *collection of operations that performs a single logical function* in a database application. Each transaction is a unit of both atomicity and consistency.

The database system must therefore perform failure recovery, that is, it must detect system failures and restore the database to the state that existed prior to the occurrence of the failure.
