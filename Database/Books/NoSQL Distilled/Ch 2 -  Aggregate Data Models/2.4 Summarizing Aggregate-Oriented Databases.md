1. Within that notion of aggregate, we have some differences. The key-value data model treats the aggregate as an opaque whole, which means *you can only do key lookup for the whole aggregateâ€”you cannot run a query nor retrieve a part of the aggregate*.

2. The document model makes the aggregate transparent to the database allowing you to *do queries and partial retrievals*. However, since the document has no schema, the database cannot act much on the structure of the document to optimize the storage and retrieval of parts of the aggregate.

3. Column-family models divide the aggregate into column families, allowing the database to *treat them as units of data within the row aggregate*. This imposes some structure on the aggregate but allows the database to take advantage of that structure to improve its accessibility
