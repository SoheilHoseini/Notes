One of the most obvious shifts with NoSQL is a move away from the relational model. Each NoSQL solution has a different model that it uses, which we put into four categories widely used in the NoSQL ecosystem: **key-value**, **document**, **column-family**, and **graph**. Of these, the first three share a common characteristic of their data models which we will call *aggregate orientation*.

The relational model takes the information that we want to store and divides it into tuples (rows). A tuple is a limited data structure: It captures a set of values, so you cannot nest one tuple within another to get nested records, nor can you put a list of values or tuples within another.

Aggregate is a term that comes from Domain-Driven Design. In Domain-Driven Design, an aggregate is a collection of related objects that we wish to treat as a unit. Dealing in aggregates makes it much easier for these databases to handle operating on a cluster, since the aggregate makes a natural unit for replication and sharding.
