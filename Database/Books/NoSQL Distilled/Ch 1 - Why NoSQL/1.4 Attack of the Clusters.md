Coping with the increase in data and traffic required more computing resources. To handle this kind of increase, you have two choices: up or out. Scaling up implies bigger machines, more processors, disk storage, and memory. But bigger machines get more and more expensive, not to mention that there are real limits as your size increases. The alternative is to use lots of small machines in a cluster. 

A cluster of small machines can use commodity hardware and ends up being cheaper at these kinds of scales. As large properties moved towards clusters, that revealed a new problemâ€”relational databases are not designed to be run on clusters. Commercial relational databases are usually priced on a single-server assumption, so running on a cluster raised prices.
