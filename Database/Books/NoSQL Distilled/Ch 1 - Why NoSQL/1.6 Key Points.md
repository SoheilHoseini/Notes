- Relational databases have been a successful technology providing persistence, concurrency control, and an integration mechanism.

- Application developers have been frustrated with the impedance mismatch between the relational model and the in-memory data structures.

- There is a movement away from using databases as integration points towards encapsulating databases within applications and integrating through services.

- The vital factor for a change in data storage was the need to support large volumes of data by running on clusters. Relational databases are not designed to run efficiently on clusters.

- The common characteristics of NoSQL databases are
	- Not using the relational model
	- Running well on clusters
	- Open-source
	- Built for the 21st century web estates
	- Schemaless
