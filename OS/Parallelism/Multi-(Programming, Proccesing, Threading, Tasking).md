##### Multi-Programming
Multiprogramming is known as keeping several programs in the main memory at the same time ready for execution on a single CPU.

##### Multi-Processing
A computer using more than one CPU at a time. Multiprocessing refers to the hardware (i.e. the CPU units) rather than the software (i.e. running processes).

**Multiprogramming vs Multiprocessing**
-   A system can be both multi programmed by having multiple programs running at the same time and multiprocessing by having more than one physical processor. The difference between multiprocessing and multiprogramming is that multiprocessing is basically executing a couple of processes at the same time on multiple processors, whereas multi programming is keeping several programs in main memory and executing them concurrently using a single CPU only.

-   Multiprocessing occurs by means of parallel processing whereas multiprogramming occurs by switching from one process to other (phenomenon called as context switching).

##### Multi-Tasking
Running multiple tasks (applications) on a single CPU. In a more general sense, multitasking refers to having multiple programs, processes, tasks, threads running at the same time.

**Multitasking vs Multiprogramming**
The major way in which multitasking differs from multi programming is that multi programming works solely on the concept of context switching whereas multitasking is based on time sharing alongside the concept of context switching.

##### Multi-Threading
Multithreading is the ability of a process to manage its use by more than one user at a time and to manage multiple requests by the same user without having to have multiple copies of the program. In VLC media player, one thread is used for opening the VLC media player, one thread for playing a particular song and another thread for adding new songs to the playlist.
