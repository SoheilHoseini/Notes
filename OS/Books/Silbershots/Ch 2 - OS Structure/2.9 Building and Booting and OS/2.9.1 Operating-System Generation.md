To generate (or build) an operating system from scratch, we must follow these steps:

1. Write the operating system source code (or obtain previously written source code).
2. Configure the operating system for the system on which it will run.
3. Compile the operating system.
4. Install the operating system.
5. Boot the computer and its new operating system

Configuring the system involves specifying which features will be included, and this varies by operating system. Typically, parameters describing how the system is configured is stored in a configuration file.

At one extreme, a system administrator can use it to modify a copy of the operating-system source code. Then the operating system is completely compiled (known as a system build). Data declarations, initializations, and constants, along with compilation, produce an output-object version of the operating system that is tailored to the system described in the configuration file.

At a slightly less tailored level, the system description can lead to the selection of precompiled object modules from an existing library. These modules are linked together to form the generated operating system. This process allows the library to contain the device drivers for all supported I/O devices
