A system can be made modular in many ways. One method is the layered approach, in which the operating system is broken into a number of layers (levels). The bottom layer (layer 0) is the hardware; the highest (layer N) is the user interface.

The main advantage of the layered approach is simplicity of construction and debugging. The layers are selected so that each uses functions (operations) and services of only lower-level layers. This approach simplifies debugging and system verification. 

Each layer is implemented only with operations provided by lower-level layers. A layer does not need to know how these operations are implemented; it needs to know only what these operations do.

Nevertheless, relatively few operating systems use a pure layered approach. One reason involves the challenges of appropriately defining the functionality of each layer. In addition, the overall performance of such systems is poor due to the overhead of requiring a user program to traverse through multiple layers to obtain an operating-system service.
