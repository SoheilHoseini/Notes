Perhaps the best current methodology for operating-system design involves using **loadable kernel modules (LKMs)**. Here, the kernel has a set of core components and can link in additional services via modules, either at boot time or during run time. This type of design is common in modern implementations of UNIX, such as Linux, macOS, and Solaris, as well as Windows.

The idea of the design is for the kernel to provide core services, while other services are implemented dynamically, as the kernel is running. Linking services dynamically is preferable to adding new features directly to the kernel, which would require recompiling the kernel every time a change was made.

It is more flexible than a layered system, because any module can call any other module. The approach is also similar to the microkernel approach in that the primary module has only core functions and knowledge of how to load and communicate with other modules; but it is more efficient, because modules do not need to invoke message passing in order to communicate.
