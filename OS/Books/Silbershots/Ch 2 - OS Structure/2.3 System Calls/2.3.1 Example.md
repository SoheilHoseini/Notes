Before we discuss how an operating system makes system calls available, letâ€™s first use an example to illustrate how system calls are used: writing a simple program to read data from one file and copy them to another file.

An approach is for the program to ask the user for the names. In an interactive system, this approach will require a sequence of system calls, first to write a prompting message on the screen and then to read from the keyboard the characters that define the two files.

Once the two file names have been obtained, the program must open the input file and create and open the output file. Each of these operations requires another system call. Possible error conditions for each system call must be handled. For example, when the program tries to open the input file, it may find that there is no file of that name or that the file is protected against access. In these cases, the program should output an error message (another sequence of system calls) and then terminate abnormally (another system call).

When both files are set up, we enter a loop that reads from the input file (a system call) and writes to the output file (another system call).

Finally, after the entire file is copied, the program may close both files (two system calls), write a message to the console or window (more system calls), and finally terminate normally (the final system call). T
