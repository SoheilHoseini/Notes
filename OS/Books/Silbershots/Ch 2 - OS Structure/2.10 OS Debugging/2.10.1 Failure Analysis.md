If a process fails, most operating systems write the error information to a log file to alert system administrators or users that the problem occurred. The operating system can also take a **core dump**—a capture of the memory of the process—and store it in a file for later analysis. (Memory was referred to as the “core” in the early days of computing.) Running programs and core dumps can be probed by a debugger, which allows a programmer to explore the code and memory of a process at the time of failure.

A failure in the kernel is called a **crash**. When a crash occurs, error information is saved to a log file, and the memory state is saved to a **crash dump**.
