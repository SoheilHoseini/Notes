Performance tuning seeks to improve performance by removing processing bottlenecks. To identify bottlenecks, we must be able to monitor system performance. Thus, the operating system must have some means of computing and displaying measures of system behavior. Tools may be characterized as providing either *per-process* or *system-wide* observations. To make these observations, tools may use one of two approaches—**counters** or **tracing**.

##### 2.10.2.1 Counters
Operating systems keep track of system activity through a series of counters, such as the number of system calls made or the number of operations performed to a network device or disk. The following are examples of Linux tools that use counters:

**Per-Process**
- `ps` —reports information for a single process or selection of processes
- `top` —reports real-time statistics for current processes

**System-Wide**
- `vmstat` —reports memory-usage statistics
- `netstat` —reports statistics for network interfaces
- `iostat` —reports I/O usage for disks

##### 2.10.3 Tracing
Whereas counter-based tools simply inquire on the current value of certain statistics that are maintained by the kernel, tracing tools collect data for a specific event—such as the steps involved in a system-call invocation. The following are examples of Linux tools that trace events:

**Per-Process**
• `strace` —traces system calls invoked by a process
• `gdb` —a source-level debugger

**System-Wide**
• `perf` —a collection of Linux performance tools
• `tcpdump` —collects network packets
