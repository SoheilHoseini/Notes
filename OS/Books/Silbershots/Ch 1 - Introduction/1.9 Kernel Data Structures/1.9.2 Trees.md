In a general tree, a parent may have an unlimited number of children. In a binary tree, a parent may have at most two children, which we term the left child and the right child. A binary search tree additionally requires an ordering between the parentâ€™s two children in which left child <= right child.

When we search for an item in a binary search tree, the worst-case performance is O(n). To remedy this situation, we can use an algorithm to create a balanced binary search tree. Here, a tree containing n items has at most log n levels, thus ensuring worst-case performance of O(log n). Linux uses a balanced binary search tree (known as a red-black tree) as part its CPU-scheduling algorithm.
