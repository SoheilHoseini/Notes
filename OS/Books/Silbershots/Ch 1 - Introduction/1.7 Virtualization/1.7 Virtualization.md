Virtualization is a technology that allows us to abstract the hardware of a single computer (the CPU, memory, disk drives, network interface cards, and so forth) into several different execution environments, thereby creating the illusion that each separate environment is running on its own private computer. These environments can be viewed as different individual operating systems.

Broadly speaking, virtualization software is one member of a class that also includes **emulation**. Emulation, which involves simulating computer hardware in software, is typically used when the source CPU type is different from the target CPU type. For example, when Apple switched from the IBM Power CPU to the Intel x86 CPU for its desktop and laptop computers, it included an emulation facility called “Rosetta,” which allowed applications compiled for the IBM CPU to run on the Intel CPU. Emulation comes at a heavy price, however. Every machine-level instruction that runs natively on the source system must be translated to the equivalent function on the target system

Running multiple virtual machines allows many users to run tasks on a system designed for a single user. Later, in response to problems with running multiple Microsoft Windows applications on the Intel x86 CPU, VMware created a new virtualization technology in the form of an application that ran on Windows. That application ran one or more guest copies of Windows or other native x86 operating systems, each running its own applications. (See figure bellow)

Windows was the **host** operating system, and the VMware application was the virtual machine manager (VMM). The VMM runs the **guest** operating systems, manages their resource use, and protects each guest from the others.
