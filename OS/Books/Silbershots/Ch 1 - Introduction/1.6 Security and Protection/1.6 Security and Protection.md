If a computer system has multiple users and allows the concurrent execution of multiple processes, then access to data must be regulated. For that purpose, mechanisms ensure that files, memory segments, CPU, and other resources can be operated on by only those processes that have gained proper authorization from the operating system.

Protection and security require the system to be able to distinguish among all its users. Most operating systems maintain a list of user names and associated user identifier (user IDs). In Windows parlance, this is a security ID (SID). These numerical IDs are unique, one per user. When a user logs in to the system, the authentication stage determines the appropriate user ID for the user. That user ID is associated with all of the userâ€™s processes and threads.

In some circumstances, we wish to distinguish among sets of users rather than individual users. To accomplish this, we need to define a group name and the set of users belonging to that group.
