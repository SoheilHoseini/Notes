Free software (sometimes referred to as free/libre software) not only makes source code available but also is licensed to allow no-cost use, redistribution, and modification. Open-source software does not necessarily offer such licensing. Thus, although all free software is open source, some open-source software is not “free.” 

GNU/Linux is the most famous open-source operating system, with some distributions free and others open source only. Microsoft Windows is a well-known example of the opposite closed-source approach. Windows is proprietary software—Microsoft owns it, restricts its use, and carefully protects its source code. Apple’s macOS operating system comprises a hybrid approach. It contains an open-source kernel named Darwin but includes proprietary, closed-source components as well.

Starting with the source code allows the programmer to produce binary code that can be executed on a system. Doing the opposite—reverse engineering the source code from the binaries—is quite a lot of work, and useful items such as comments are never recovered.

Arguably, open-source code is more secure than closed-source code because many more eyes are viewing the code.
