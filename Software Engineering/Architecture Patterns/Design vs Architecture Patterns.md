Diagrams about architecture represent the loftiest level looking down, whereas class diagrams are at the most atomic level. The purpose of architecture patterns is to understand how the major parts of the system fit together, how messages and data flow through the system, and other structural concerns.

Architecture represents scaffolding, the frameworks that everything else sits upon. Design patterns represent a way to structure classes to solve common problems. While both are designed to add clarity and understanding, they operate at different levels of abstraction.

Architects must have both kinds of patterns at their disposal: design patterns to build the best internal structure, and architectural patterns to help define and maintain the underlying scaffolding of the application.
