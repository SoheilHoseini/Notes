Behave is behavior-driven development, Python style which uses gherkin syntax. Behave operates on directories containing:

1. [feature files](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/#feature-files) written by your Business Analyst / Sponsor / whoever with your behavior scenarios in it, and
2. a “steps” directory with [Python step implementations](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/#python-step-implementations) for the scenarios.
