To deal with the shortages of RAM capacity, virtual memory helps by transferring data from RAM to  disk. This can be achieved through either paging or segmenting. Some systems use both of these.

###### Paging
Divides the RAM into sections (paging files); When the computer uses up its RAM, pages that aren't used, are transferred to hard drive, designated for the virtual memory.

###### Segmentation
Divides virtual memory into segments of different lengths. Segments not in use in RAM, can be moved to the virtual memory space on the hard drive.
