We emphasize that a program by itself is not a process. A program is a *passive entity*, like the contents of a file stored on disk, whereas a process is an *active entity*. A single-threaded process has one program counter specifying the next instruction to execute. The execution of such a process must be sequential. The CPU executes one instruction of the process after another, until the process completes. Further, at any time, one instruction at most is executed on behalf of the process. Thus, although two processes may be associated with the same program, they are nevertheless considered two separate execution sequences. A multithreaded process has several program counters, each pointing to the next instruction to execute for a given thread.

A process is the unit of work in a system. A system consists of a collection of processes, some of which are OS processes and the rest of which are user processes. All these processes can potentially execute concurrently—by multiplexing on a single CPU core—or in parallel across multiple CPU cores.

The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with process management:

- Creating and deleting both user and system processes
- Scheduling processes and threads on the CPUs
- Suspending and resuming processes
- Providing mechanisms for process synchronization
- Providing mechanisms for process communication
