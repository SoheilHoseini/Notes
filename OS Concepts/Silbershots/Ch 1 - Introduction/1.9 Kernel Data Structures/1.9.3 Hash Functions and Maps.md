A hash function takes data as its input, performs a numeric operation on the data, and returns a numeric value. 
One use of a hash function is to implement a hash map, which associates (or maps) [key:value] pairs using a hash function. Once the mapping is established, we can apply the hash function to the key to obtain the value from the hash map. For example, suppose that a user name is mapped to a password (like the hashed username is key associated with the password). Password authentication then proceeds as follows: a user enters her user name and password. The hash function is applied to the user name, which is then used to retrieve the password. The retrieved password is then compared with the password entered by the user for authentication.
