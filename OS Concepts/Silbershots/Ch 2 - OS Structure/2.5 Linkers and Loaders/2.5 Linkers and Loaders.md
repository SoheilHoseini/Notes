Usually, a program resides on disk as a binary executable file—for example, `a.out` or `prog.exe`. To run on a CPU, the program must be brought into memory and placed in the context of a process.

1. Source files are compiled into *object files* that are designed to be loaded into any physical memory location, a format known as an *relocatable object file*
2. The **linker** combines these relocatable object files into a single *binary executable file*.
	1. During the linking phase, other object files or libraries may be included as well, such as the standard C or math library (specified with the flag `-lm` ).
3. A **loader** is used to load the binary executable file into memory, where it is eligible to run on a CPU core.

An activity associated with linking and loading is **relocation**, which assigns final addresses to the program parts and adjusts code and data in the program to match those addresses so that, for example, the code can call library functions and access its variables as it executes. 

In Figure 2.11, we see that to run the loader, all that is necessary is to enter the name of the executable file on the command line. When a program name is entered on the command line on UNIX systems — for example, `./main` — the shell first creates a new process to run the program using the `fork()` system call. The shell then invokes the loader with the `exec()` system call, passing `exec()` the name of the executable file. The loader then loads the specified program into memory using the address space of the newly created process. (When a GUI interface is used, *double-clicking on the icon* associated with the executable file invokes the loader using a similar mechanism.)

The process described thus far assumes that all libraries are linked into the executable file and loaded into memory. In reality, most systems allow a program to *dynamically* link libraries as the program is loaded.
