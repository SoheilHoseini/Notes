When we run our app using `docker-compose`, docker builds a network which for the containers and they can talk to each other through this network. For example take the example in [compose]([[Compose]]) section with three services. After running the app, we can open a shell session in the frontend container and ping the backend container. (We must login as root user).
Each container has a IP address on the docker network. There is also a DNS Resolver inside each container in which when we need to communicate with other containers, this internal DNS Resolver asks for the IP of the target container from the  DNS Server of the docker and the creates a connection with it.
