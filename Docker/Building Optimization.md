Docker image has a layering structure where each instruction in the docker file is one or a collection of layers. Docker has an optimization mechanism in which every time we are going to build an image, it checks if an instruction has changed or not; If there is a change in the instruction (layer), it has to rebuild it but if not, it uses its cash to retrieve previous data and save time.
There is point that layers are constructed from first instruction in the docker file to the last one, each built upon the previous one and if a layer is rebuilt, all the following layers have to be rebuilt as well and that would take a lot of time. Hence, it is better to separate installation of third-party dependencies from copying app files. 
In commands like `COPY . .` docker can not tell what has changed so it has to check all the files as well which is time consuming. To solve this, we can first copy files containing list of dependencies and then install third-party libraries. This way the installation process would only reoccurs if a dependency has changes otherwise it would use it from its cache.
