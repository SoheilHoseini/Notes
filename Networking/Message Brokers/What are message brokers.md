In [microservice]([[Microservice]]) architecture, there are several services each handling a part of the application functionality. To communicate between these services, we use a message broker like [NATS]([[NATS]]), [RabbitMQ]([[RabbitMQ]]) or [Kafka]([[Kafka]]). These brokers control the distribution of messages between different services using different tools such as message queues.
