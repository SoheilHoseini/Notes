In [microservice](Microservice.md) architecture, there are several services each handling a part of the application functionality. To communicate between these services, we use a message broker like [NATS]([[NATS]]), [RabbitMQ]([[RabbitMQ]]) or [Kafka]([[Kafka]]). These brokers control the distribution of messages between different services using different tools such as message queues.
Consider another example in which there are two services; First one is for the customer and the other is for handling notifications. We send a message from customer to notification service but there a problem has happened so it'll take a while to process and respond; Meanwhile the customer service has to wait until the process is done and response is sent back while it's not necessary for the customer to wait for that. At this time we can use a message queue (i.e. message broker) so it handles the messages to the notification service and queue them until the processing has been fulfilled.
